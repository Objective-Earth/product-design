About Objective Earth
---
We have OKR tools for "private companies" (like @betterworks). How about we build an OKR tool that anybody can join? Like a Social Network where people work together on "Objectives of Earth". https://www.Objective.Earth/ is one such attempt. Please give your valuable feedback. We are right now in product design phase

**WHY:**  
[Majority of population is unaware of global problems](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?q=Predictors+of+public+climate+change+awareness). In the past, [making population aware of problems has helped solved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_up_LPG_subsidy#cite_note-2)  

**WHAT:**  
Objective.Earth would be a social network, where its main agenda is to align people towards [Sustainability Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

**HOW:**  
We have OKR tools for "private companies" (like betterworks.com). How about we build an OKR tool that anybody can join? Like a Social Network where people work together on "Objectives of Earth". People can collaborate on "what is the right thing to do". And the ones who do those right things can "get paid".  

Please check videos WHY, WHAT and HOW of Objective.Earth on our website 

About Product Design

Please give your valuable feedback. We are right now in product design phase

[Before we start coding, we would do product design](https://gitlab.com/smarter-codes/guidelines/software-engineering/about-software-engineering#option2-architect-review-code-review-deploy-review-repeat) of our solution. By employing your [UX/UI skills](https://github.com/togiberlin/ui-ux-designer-roadmap#-user-interface-designer-roadmap), and a couple of [Design Sprints](https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide) we would be producing the following artifacts
* [Lean Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ)
* [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)
* [Task Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHhAZE2Gh7U)
* [Information Architecture](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html)
* [Wireframes & UI Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/prototyping/low-fi-and-hi-fi-prototyping/)

Go ahead and create an issue for each of the artifacts above.
