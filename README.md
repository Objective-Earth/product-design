## About

[Objective.earth](http://objective.earth/) is a social [OKR tool](https://www.g2.com/categories/objectives-and-key-results-okr) that helps the community to align themselves towards the [17 SDG goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). It is also a social network, where the community can talk about "Problems of a region" and "Solutions for those problems". On [Objective.earth](http://objective.earth/), any individual or organization will be able to crowdfund and hire people to solve the problems they care about.

OE platform strongly believes in appreciating and rewarding those who are stepping forward to the right thing for the earth. Read more [Rewarding DOers..](https://www.objective.earth/whys/rewarding-doers)

-   [OKR tools](https://www.g2.com/categories/objectives-and-key-results-okr) : for their data-driven approach e.g, [Lattice](https://lattice.com/), [Weekdone](https://weekdone.com/okr), [Gtmhub](https://gtmhub.com/), [Betterworks](https://www.betterworks.com/)
-   [Wikimedia foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing): for open community features and handling masses.
-   Social Media platforms: for easy to use, easy to navigate, community-building tools e.g, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/explore), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
-   Crowdfunding platforms: for showing how people can become philanthropists with ease e.g, [Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/), [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav), [Globalgiving](https://www.globalgiving.org/)

**Objective.Earth depends on community members to**

-   Invest their Money - [to act as donors](https://opencollective.com/) and sponsor DOers( people who doing groundwork)

## Release 1 Roadmap

The following is the list of WHAT we are building in Objective.Earth so that it can solve the problems of our Target Users (following **[UCD](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design)**). The entire product has been broken down into major chunks termed “Epics”. Each epic contain multiple minor features within it. The product design team at Objective.Earth works on each epic and pushes them out to the engineering team at an average of 1 epic per week.
