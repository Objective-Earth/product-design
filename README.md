[Before we start coding, we would do product design](https://gitlab.com/smarter-codes/guidelines/software-engineering/about-software-engineering#option2-architect-review-code-review-deploy-review-repeat) of our solution. By employing your [UX/UI skills](https://github.com/togiberlin/ui-ux-designer-roadmap#-user-interface-designer-roadmap), and a couple of [Design Sprints](https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide) we would be producing the following artifacts
* [Lean Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ)
* [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)
* [Task Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHhAZE2Gh7U)
* [Information Architecture](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html)
* [Wireframes & UI Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/prototyping/low-fi-and-hi-fi-prototyping/)

Go ahead and create an issue for each of the artifacts above.
