**We are mix of** 

-   [OKR tool](https://www.g2.com/categories/objectives-and-key-results-okr) : for their data-driven approach e.g, [Lattice](https://lattice.com/), [Weekdone](https://weekdone.com/okr), [Gtmhub](https://gtmhub.com/), [Betterworks](https://www.betterworks.com/)
-   Social Media platform: for easy to use, easy to navigate, community-building tools e.g, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/explore), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
-   Crowdfunding platform: for showing how people can become philanthropists with ease e.g, [Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/), [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav), [Globalgiving](https://www.globalgiving.org/)

**We are inspired by** 

-   [Wikimedia foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing): for their open-source management style. Wikipedia, having contributors from many areas of the world, provides its readers with a "world view" that could not be provided simply by few contributors from a limited region. This also serves to eliminate cultural bias in articles. [Most anyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IP_editors_are_human_too) can click the "edit" link and edit an article.

## Release 1 Roadmap

The following is the list of WHAT we are building in Objective.Earth so that it can solve the problems of our Target Users (following **[UCD](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design)**). The entire product has been broken down into major chunks termed “Epics”. Each epic contain multiple minor features within it. The product design team at Objective.Earth works on each epic and pushes them out to the engineering team at an average of 1 epic per week.
