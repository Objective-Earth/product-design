## Welcome to [Objective.Earth](http://oe.smarter.codes:8080/index.php/Main_Page) contributing guide!

First off, thank you for your interest in Objective.Earth and for wanting to contribute! 

Everyone or anyone can contribute here. We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. In this guide, we’ll discuss how we are building Objective.Earth. This should give you a good sense of our process and where you might want to fit in.

## Getting Started

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/Objective-Earth/product-design).Here are few links to help you getting started!

We have taken an agile methodology approach to our project management and software development which helps us update our community every week. The entire product has been broken down into major chunks termed “Epics”. Each epic contain multiple minor features within it. The product design team at Objective.Earth works on each epic and pushes them out to the engineering team at an average of 1 epic per week.

Check out the Roadmap to see our planned process, and current sprint to see what we are working on right now.

Product Design
Once a feature has been defined, typically it will be taken on by a product designer. Here, they will produce low fi mocks, get feedback from team and community, and iterate.

Once the main UX flows have been dialed in, present it with annotation in Figma/Adobe XD and update the same in issue, and provide a description, lighting demo and the wireframe link.

Features that are ready for design are tagged ‘Design Needed’. Once a feature has had a reasonably complete visual design it should be tagged as ‘Help Wanted’.
